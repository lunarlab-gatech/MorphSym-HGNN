# Dataset Installation and Structure

Please navigate to https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/proprioceptive-sensor-dataset-quadruped-robots and login to access the data. Download the desired dataset folder, and extract the contents into the "datasets" directory. The provided .gitignore file should prevent any of the data from being committed.

After extracting, don't change the folders or locations of the data. This will allow our code to locate the proper files.
